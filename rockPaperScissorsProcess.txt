PSEUDOCODE:

#set variable keepPlaying to true

#while keepPlaying is true:
    #print statement welcoming players to the game
    #print statment stating the rules (best 2 out of 3 press 'q' to quit)
    #make a key that assigns a number to each coice for the computer
        #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
    #Import the random function
    #set computer's score to 0
    #set player's score to o

    #while the player's and the computer's score is < 2 
       
        #computer's choice = randome number between 1 and 3 (random fuction created here
        #player's choice = input(ask player to select rock, paper or scissors
        #start checking user option
        #userChoice = userChoice.lower
       
        #if player input 'q'
            set keePlayigng to false 
            stop the loop
       
        #else if (player inputs rock and the computer chooses rock) or (player inputes paper and computer chooses paper) or (scissors and scissors)
            # print out DRAW
            #print player's score and computer's score
       
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer scissors) or (player inputs scissors and computer paper) or (player inputs paper and computer rock)
            #add one to the player's score 
            #print player's and computer's score
       
        #else if (comp inputs rock and player scissors) or (comp inputs scissors and player paper) or (comp inputs paper and player rock)
            #add one to the player's score
            #print player's and computer's score
       
        #else:
            #tell the user their input was not valid
            
     #print statement thanking the player for playing 
     
     #if player's score is 2:
        #print statmement letting player know that they won
     
     #if computer's score is 2:
        #print statmement letting player know that compute won
     
     #print player and computer's score
